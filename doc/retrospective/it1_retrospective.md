During Iteration 1, our team had successfully completed the tasks which we had laid out in our backlog: 

- We successfully set up our supabase project, providing the foundation for database management
- We created a basic table called “Event” in our database.
- Updated ReadMe and documentation of project
- Designed and implemented a simple UI to display the odds fetched from the database for the user
- Set up Cron Job to fetch data from odds API and store it in our database
- Update UML
- Update SRS

I believe we did a good job setting a realistic goal for what we can achieve in the time we were allotted, while still ensuring progress was achieved. For this iteration, there was not anything that we did not deliver. 

We faced a few small issues getting deployment set up, however in general we did not really face any challenges during this iteration.

In terms of getting better for future iterations, we should link our pull requests to our issues as well as provide better descriptions for the issues that include our motivation and implementation  plan for the changes. We should also include screenshots and descriptions whenever it is possible for our pull requests.
