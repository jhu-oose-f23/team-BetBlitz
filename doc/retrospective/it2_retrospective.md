During iteration 2, our team successfully completed all the tasks planned for the iteration. To name a few:

- Setting up authentication for the website to allow users to create accounts and log in
- Setting up CRON job to update event results in the database once per day
- Creating a modal that will be used in future iterations for placing bets
- Creating a navbar to help users easily navigate the website
- Implementing searching functionality to allow for easily finding bets
- Creating a page to allow users to create fun messages using AI that they can send to their friends

This iteration went well but we did encounter more issues than the previous iterations. Firstly, since the API we are using limits us to 500 queries per month for the free tier, we had to find a way to limit our usage. This came in the form of a CRON job which took some time to configure in Vercel but we eventually got it working.

Additionally, we are all still mastering the stack we chose for our project. Some users are very experienced in one part of the stack but not others. I think we did a good job dividing up tasks so that people's strengths could show, but we could certainly improve on it in the next iteration.

For the next iteration, the main thing we need to address is picking up speed. Now that everyone has gotten a basic understanding of how the app works, we want to pick up more stories and start implementing features that will make the app fun to use! Additionally, we need to continue linking pull requests and including screenshots and descriptions.
