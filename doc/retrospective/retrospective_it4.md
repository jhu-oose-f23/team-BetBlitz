In iteration 4 our group was able to complete all of our planned goals: 
  - Password functionality for leagues
  - Individual League pages where you can see fellow members and other info
  - Max member checks for leagues
  - New page to place bets corresponding to a league
  - Update Cron Job to reward users for successful parlays
  - Table to display recent bets on the analytics page
  - Create UI for viewing a Parlay
  - Create UI for creating a Parlay

We overall did a good job and I believe in this iteration we were well paced with our tasks and completed them in a timely manner. Our
group members also did a good job of helping each other with problems that we ran into with their different expertise. For our future 
iteration we could work on testing our features that are in place to ensure that they flawlessly execute to go along with how we have
been getting our tasks done until this point.
