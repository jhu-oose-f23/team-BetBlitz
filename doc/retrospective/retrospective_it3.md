In iteration 3 our group managed to achieve all of the goals we had mapped out such as 
  - An analytics page to view your personal betting statistics
  - A page to join leagues that are already exisitng with a form to create your own league and edit things like max players, and start date
  - A page to view all the leagues that you are currently a part of along with the details of those leagues
  - A streaming feature for the AI chirp feature to view the message being created
  - Filtering by leagues on the odds page as well as giving each user a currency that they can use to actually place bets

Overall, the iteration went pretty well with everything being delivered, but we were under a bit of a crunch towards the deadline for the
iteration which is something that we should aim to avoid in the future. We also ran into a bug or two with the leagues feature joining and
working with the database making sure everything gets stored correctly. 

Most if not all of our group has now had to interact with all the various parts of the project now, so for splitting up tasks in the next
iteration I think we can be a bit more widespread with features we are looking to implement and how quickly we should be able to get them
done.
